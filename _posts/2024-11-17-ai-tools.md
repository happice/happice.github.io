description: Hi! My name is Alice. I totally "reasearched" background images AI tools.<br>My friends and I found few website for background images, for example, Dall-e, Photoroom, Midjourney, and Hotpot. However, Photoroom and Midjourney were not so helpfull...It is not an AI tool. <br>Dall-e was made, January 2021, the inventor of Dall-e is Aditya Ramesh, but OpenAI introduced Dall-e. Hotpot is free but, you have to pay money to use Dall-e. The most usefull AI tool is Hotpot since you can create and it is also... FREE!! I will probably rate Dall-e as 2.5/5 and Hotpot as 4.2/5.
