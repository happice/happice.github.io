description: This is an animation by Alice and Eiley.<br>We made this with Scratch to code and Canva to design the backdrops and characters. The animation also relates to the SDGs 6. My character is the Glazed Guardian who goes to get Frosted Boba since Frosted Boba can help.<br>Overall, this is a short animation where, an evil gummy bear, Swagger poisened the water in Happy Land. So, the good heros, Glazed Guardian, Applestream, etc. save Happy Land.
