The animation also relates to the SDGs 6. My character is the Glazed Guardian who goes to get Frosted Boba since Frosted Boba can help.<br>Overall, this is a short animation where, an evil gummy bear, Swagger poisened the water in Happy Land. So, the good heros, Glazed Guardian, Applestream, etc. save Happy Land.
